#### Connect delete to React Frontend

Great work you've managed to complete the first challenge. Pretty easy yea? Well, let's up the game. The delete feature will allow the user from the webpage to delete and remove images from the S3 bucket. 

In this challenge you must make two edits to get the delete feature to work.

1. You will need your **Invoke URL** and the only file you should be looking at is `frontend/src/Components/ImageGridList.js`.

2. Test the app. To test the delete feature go to the gallery page. If you select one of the images, there should be an option to delete. If successful, when you select the button after the page has refreshed the image should now be gone.
