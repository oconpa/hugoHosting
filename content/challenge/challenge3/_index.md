#### Connect gallery detection to React Frontend

Oh you finished the last challenge... Ok I see you want a real challenge, well get ready for this one. 

The gallery detection feature will allow the user from the gallery page to perform detections on previously uploaded images by pressing the tick icon on the top left of each image. 

1. In this challenge you will have 3 edits to complete in order to get the feature operational. Remember you should only be editing the REPLACE ME's in the code, nothing else. And you should only be editing the contents of `frontend/src/Components/ImageGridList.js`.

2. Test the app. To test the gallery detection, go to the gallery page. On the top left of each image should be a tick icon. If you click it, if all things go well you should get back detection for the image.
