#### Connect charts to React Frontend

Well, well, I severely underestimated you. You make a worthy foe. Welcome to the last and final challenge. This challenge will not only test your frontend capabilities, but will also require you to have a look at your lambda for some help *hint hint*. 

The charts route is responsible for the summary data analysis on your gallery images. It will look to pull and summarise whether a person is smiling or not, but also categorise their age range. 

In this ulimate challenge you will have to make a grand total of 9 edits in order to get the program to work.

**IMPORTANT:** The only code you should be changing is the **REPLACE ME** tags.

1. For this challenge you will need to:
- Have copied your **Invoke URL**
- Access to the lambda for referencing the chart route functionality

2. You should only be making changes to frontend/src/Components/Charts.js.

3. Test the app. To test the charts feature, go to the gallery page. If you have some images in the gallery the charts at the bottom should be populated with smile and age metrics. For example, if you upload a 20-year-old person smiling then you should have one unit for smiling and one unit for 20-39-year-old on the charts.
