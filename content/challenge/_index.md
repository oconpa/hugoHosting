**Congratulations** on getting this far in the workshop. As promised this section is your opportunity to reap on some **AWS credits**. In this workshop we have 4 challenges for you to try out. Each challenge relates to one functionality in the **ML React App**. Your job is to successfully connect the backend routes (lambda) through API to the web application and have the app run successfully.

As you progress through the challenges, the instructions will become more vague with more tasks to complete. Don't be disheartened, try your best, we believe in you.

*For reference as you complete the challenges your app should run similar to **http://facial-hosting.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/***

**Good luck**, remember the faster you complete the challenges and show to your trainer, the more points you accumulate to win some AWS credits. Feel free to message you're designated breakout room AWS reps for hints and help.
