### How to Build a Facial Recognition Full-Stack Web Application **using AWS Rekognition**

Welcome!

If you’ve built an application using **Amazon Web Services** in the past or understand key cloud concepts, this workshop is suited for you. You will use AWS Rekognition to build an online gallery of ML detections, and use AWS services to scan, detect and draw data science inferences from the scans.

**What is Rekognition and how can I use it in my personal projects?**

Glad you ask! Rekognition is Amazon's machine learning powerhouse, allowing you to detect from a wide range of plug'n'play models. Whether it's object detection, celerity detection, or even text from an image, AWS has the tools to easily plug ML capabilities into your site to stand out.

In this workshop we will focus on building a fullstack face detection gallery app and highlight:

1. The benefits of using ML tools on AWS to build web applications.
2. Provide a high-level overview of key AWS services, including Lambda, S3, API gateway, etc.
3. Perfoming a simple data analysis on Rekognition results.

And without further adieu **let's do this!**
